Hello!! Feel free to check out my SAW page and sign my ATA if you’d like! ✦

A little about me, thanks I didn't add to my straw or rentry:

I’m Mic ,  an alter in the Meowatastic System. I don’t front very often unless our co-host, Mystic, is feeling really stressed or uncomfortable with fronting. I don’t usually play Ponytail, but since I actually enjoy it, I might start using it more often!

My roles, in full explanation for anyone curious:

✦ **Caretaker** —> A caretaker alter focuses on looking after the system’s emotional and mental well-being. This can include offering comfort, grounding others during stress, helping with self-care, and trying to keep things stable when emotions run high.

✦ **Boundary Manager** —> A boundary manager helps set, enforce, and protect personal boundaries for the system. This includes deciding what information is safe to share, when to say no, and stepping in if interactions become overwhelming or unsafe.

✦ Fronting indicator: You’ll know I’m fronting because I’ll be using my Mic skin.

✦ Tone indicators: Tone indicators are appreciated and needed, I'm not good at picking up tone through text.
