A little about me, things I didn't add to my straw or rentry:

I’m Mic ,  an alter in the Meowatastic System. I don’t front very often unless our co-host, Mystic, is feeling really stressed or uncomfortable with fronting. I don’t usually play Ponytail, but since I actually enjoy it, I might start using it more often!

My roles, in full explanation for anyone curious:

✦ **Caretaker**
"A caretaker alter focuses on the overall well-being of the system, both emotionally and mentally. This role often involves offering comfort, reassurance, and grounding when others are stressed, overwhelmed, or in distress. Caretakers may help with self-care reminders, emotional regulation, and creating a sense of safety during difficult moments. They tend to be more attentive to the needs of others in the system and may step in during high-stress situations to help stabilize emotions and prevent burnout or shutdowns."

✦ **Boundary Manager**
"A boundary manager alter is responsible for establishing, communicating, and enforcing boundaries to keep the system safe. This includes deciding what personal information is okay to share, recognizing when conversations or situations become unhealthy, and stepping in to say no when needed. Boundary managers may limit interactions, end conversations, or redirect topics if something feels overwhelming or unsafe. If a boundary manager becomes more firm or direct, it is not meant to be rude, it is done to protect the system’s comfort, safety, and emotional health."

✦ Fronting indicator: You’ll know I’m fronting because I’ll be using my Mic skin.

✦ Tone indicators: Tone indicators are appreciated and needed, I'm not good at picking up tone through text.
